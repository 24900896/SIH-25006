## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.
